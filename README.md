•	LOOKUP functions (VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, HLOOKUP) help in mapping relevant data across different tables to ensure consistency.

4.  Data Analysis & Summarization (Pivot Tables & Excel Functions)
•	Pivot Tables are created to summarize key metrics such as total sales, region-wise performance, and top customers.
•	Dynamic calculations help in analyzing trends, filtering data, and deriving insights.

5. Data Visualization & Interaction (Pivot Charts, Slicers & Dashboards)
•	Pivot Charts transform numerical data into interactive visual reports for better understanding.
•	Slicers & Filters allow users to interactively explore data, enabling quick decision-making.
•	The final dashboard presents a visually appealing, data-driven story for business insights.
